# N-body System

This repository is designed to calculate and display the evolution of an N-body system. You can set up the initial condition of the system you desire to analyse via the execution script (which creates an input file).

You can achieve this by executing the program in two steps as following:
$ make install
$ ./execute.sh

This copies the executable to the bin folder and creates the various data, plots and videos. Check it out, use it as you please. 

This program was designed by Caro, Antonio and Carl.
